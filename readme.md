The Michigan Moodle Theme
======================

Michigan Moodle is a beautiful, stylish, and smart theme designed to build upon and enhance the core theme More. [Dearborn Public Schools](http://dearbornschools.org) is a K-12 school distict in Dearborn, Michigan.

The base theme is More and we borrowed features from [Aardvark](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_aardvark) and [Essential](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_essential) themes to add style and functionality.  Special thanks to Shaun Daubney and Julian Ridden for thier work which is copied here with sincerest of flattery to their amazing work.
